<h1>PIZZA HUT ONLINE AUTOMATION</h1>
<h2>Technologies used: Selenium WebDriver, Core Java, Cucumber, Gherkin, JUnit</h2>

<h3>üëâ Project Agenda: To automate functionalities on the pizzahut.co.in website using Selenium WebDriver</h3>
Scenario:

Automate a few functionalities for Pizzahut Onine application.

Design a functionality to automate testing using Selenium and Cucumber or TestNG with a Maven project.

<h2>Tools Required:</h2>
<li>Eclipse / IntelliJ <br></li>
<li>Java 1.8+ <br></li>
<li>Git <br></li>
<li>Cucumber-java maven dependency version 6.8.0<br> </li>
<li>Cucumber-junit maven dependency version 6.8.0 <br></li>
<li>Selenium maven dependency version 4.4.0 <br></li>
<li>TestNG maven dependency version 6.14.3 <br></li>
<li>Extend Report dependency <br></li>

<h2>üëâ Expected Deliverables:</h2>
<h3>Test Scenario 1: [Cucumber+JUnit]</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create a simple maven Project</li>
  <li>Add dependencies in the POM.XML file </li>
  <li>Create a cucumber feature file inside src/test called pizzahut.feature</li>
  <li>Create First scenario in feature file as given below</li>
  [Note: ‚Äú<>‚Äù refers to a parameter]
  <li>In the below scenario ‚Äú<URL>‚Äù, ‚Äú<Location>‚Äù parameters value should be driven from Cucumber Table.</li>
  <li>Use Extend Reporting while each step is PASS/FAIL</li>
</ol>

@Smoke Scenario Outline: Validate Pizzahut pizza order flow Given User launch Pizzahut application with "<URL>" When User wait for auto location black pop up screen Then User close the pop up screen And User see pop up for delivery asking for enter location Then User type address as "<Location>" And User select first auto populate drop down option When User navigate to deails page Then User validate vegetarian radio button flag is off And User clicks on Pizzas menu bar option When User select add button of any pizza from Recommended Then User see that the pizza is getting added under Your Basket And User validate pizza price plus Tax is checkout price Then User validate checkout button contains Item count And User validate checkout button contains total price count Then User clicks on Drinks option And User select Pepsi option to add into the Basket Then User see 2 items are showing under checkout button And User see total price is now more than before Then User remove the Pizza item from Basket And see Price tag got removed from the checkout button And User see 1 item showing in checkout button Then User Clicks on Checkout button And User see minimum order required pop up is getting displayed
Examples:
|URL|Location| |https://www.pizzahut.co.in/|lulu mall bangalore|
All Cucumber test data should be parameterized through Feature File scenario table.
Use Page Factory/Page object model for page HTML element
Close the driver session for the above feature file scenario using Cucumber hooks.
Convert these feature file scenarios into test steps Skeleton.
Create a stepDef file, use this Skeleton method, and implement the test per test automation flow.
Create a testRunner file and run the Cucumber test using it.


Test Scenario 2:[TestNG+Selenium]
1.Create a testNG.xml file in the same Maven project
2.Configure a test pizzahut001 inside testNG.xml file
3.Create a new java file for TestNG test implementation
4.Use Extend Reporting while each step is PASS/FAIL
5.Use an Excel Sheet to read application URL [https://www.pizzahut.co.in/]
6.TestNG test steps are given below:
Use @BeforeClass/@BeforeSuite to launch https://www.pizzahut.co.in/
A black color auto pop up screen will be displayed. Close it
Then, set the user delivery location as Lulu Mall, Bangalore
The user is now on the Deals page. Validate that the URL has text as ‚Äòdeals‚Äô
Go to sides and add any item that is below 200
Validate that the product is added under Basket but checkout button price item is still now showing
Navigate to the Drinks page
Add any two drinks so that total cart pricing is more than 200
Click on the Checkout button. The user will be navigated to the checkout page
Validate that the Online Payment radio button is selected by default
Change the Payment option to Cash
Validate that the I agree checkbox is checked by default
Enter name, mobile, and email address
Click on the Apply Gift Card link
A pop up should appear. Click on the Voucher
Give the Voucher code as 12345 and submit
Validate if an error is coming that the number is incorrect
Close the voucher pop up
The user should again navigate to your Basket page.
Use @AfterClass/@AfterSuite to quit the driver session
Configure testNG.xml to run pom.xml
All test data should be parameterized from testNG.xml
Use page object model to capture page object
Upload the project into Git
Make sure the project is running using the Maven test command
